# Description

A modern redesign of an overview of the Nike site. This project was built with react, 
and I tried to experiment with making it more responsive, specifically for mobile screens. 
I wanted to have a dynamically updating cart, but I chose to leave it as is and 
implement it in a future project when getting into new libraries.
