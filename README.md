# Description

A modern redesign of an overview of the Nike website. Created with react. Unfortunantely, the source code
for this project was lost when deploying the project to Pages and it only contains the build folder. The demo 
still works, but due to some errors on my part the source code files no longer exist on my computer or anywhere.
<br>I wanted to focus on mobile responsiveness and get more comfortable with react in this project, and I would 
have liked to have a dynamically updating cart but I chose to leave it as is and implement it in a future 
project when I am getting into other libraries.
